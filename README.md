# machine-learning-project
 we get pings from their mobile phone indicating that they are using the app.
You have been provided with 3 weeks of training data and 1 week of test data.
Training data contains id, gender, age, number of kids the customer has and all the pings
that have been received (during the training data period).
We want to predict how many hours the customer will be online / using our app on a given
day.
